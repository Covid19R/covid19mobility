Description: Scrapes trends in mobility after the Covid-19
    outbreak from different sources. Currently, the package scrapes data
    from Google <https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/>, Apple
    <https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility>, and will add others. The
    data returned uses the tidy Covid19R project data standard
    <https://covid19r.github.io/documentation/> as well as the controlled
    vocabularies for measurement types.

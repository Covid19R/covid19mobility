Description: This package is used to scrape trends in mobility from 
            different sources as related to the outbreak of Covid-19.
            Currently, the package scrapes data from Google <https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/>, 
            Apple <https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility>, and will add others. The data returned uses the tidy
            Covid19R project data standard <https://covid19r.github.io/documentation/>
            as well as the controlled vocabularies for measurement types.

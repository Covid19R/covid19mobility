From Google:
"Each Community Mobility Report dataset is presented by location
and highlights the percent change in visits to places like grocery
stores and parks within a geographic area.

Location accuracy and the understanding of categorized places
varies from region to region, so we don’t recommend using this
data to compare changes between countries, or between regions
with different characteristics (e.g. rural versus urban areas).

Changes for each day are compared to a baseline value for that
day of the week: The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day
of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3–Feb 6, 2020.
The datasets show trends over several months with the most
recent data representing approximately 2-3 days ago—this is how
long it takes to produce the datasets."

Data represents changes from baseline visits for the following types
of locations visited:
\itemize{
\item retail and recreation
\item grocery and pharmacy
\item parks
\item transit stations
\item workplaces
\item residential
